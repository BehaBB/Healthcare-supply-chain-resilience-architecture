# Healthcare Supply Chain Resilience Reference Architecture

## Overview

This repository documents a reference system architecture for healthcare
supply chains operating in environments characterized by uncertainty,
disruption, and resource constraints. The architecture focuses on analytical
and system-level design principles that support resilience, visibility, and
informed decision-making across healthcare logistics and supply networks.

The materials presented here illustrate how data, analytics, and governance
mechanisms may be structured to support continuity of healthcare operations,
rather than representing a deployable software product.

## Scope and Purpose

This reference architecture is intended for system architects, business and
systems analysts, healthcare operations teams, and organizations involved in
the design, evaluation, or modernization of healthcare supply chain systems.

The architecture emphasizes:
- System-level visibility across supply chain components
- Risk-aware and disruption-sensitive analytics
- Decision support for logistics and resource allocation
- Governance and accountability in complex supply networks

The framework is jurisdiction-agnostic and applicable to national and
institutional healthcare environments with varying regulatory and operational
constraints.

## Key Design Areas

- Healthcare supply chain data flows and integration points
- Disruption and risk modeling at system level
- Analytical support for resilience and continuity planning
- Decision-support mechanisms for operational response
- Monitoring and feedback loops for adaptive system behavior

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` — Architectural overview and analytical models  
- `diagrams/` — High-level system and risk-flow diagrams  
- `examples/` — Illustrative healthcare supply chain disruption scenarios  

## Intended Use

This repository is provided as a reference architecture and analytical
documentation resource. It does not represent a commercial product or
operational system and does not perform automated or real-time decision
execution.
